THIS IS OBSOLETE AS OF (at least) 2014. PLEASE VISIT https://github.com/transpect/epubcheck-transpect
FOR AN ALTERNATIVE AND MORE UP-TO-DATE IMPLEMENTATION THAT CREATES AN HTML REPORT.

This is a reimplementation and extension of epubcheck, using 
XML Calabash and Saxon.

It includes a CSS parser implemented in XSLT2 (in order to
run checks against certain CSS constructs that don't translate
well in kindlegen, for example).

Custom Schematron files may be specified on the command line.

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS. DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING YET.

In particular, not all current epubcheck functionality has been
implemented.

To do:
- calabash extension for reading image information (type,
  resolution, color space)
- ...

For the time being, you'll have to manually check out and update
http://epubcheck.googlecode.com/svn/branches/epub3/com.adobe.epubcheck/src/com/adobe/epubcheck
as epubcheck-xproc/epubcheck

Sample invocation:
$ ./calabash.sh -o result=report.html  xproc/kindle.xpl epubdir=../test/CSS-Compatibility-Test\ Suite
Relative filenames are relative to the xproc subdir.
