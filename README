This will be a reimplementation and extension of epubcheck, using 
XML Calabash and Saxon.

It will include a CSS parser implemented in XSLT2 (in order to
run checks against certain CSS constructs that don't translate
well in kindlegen, for example).

Custom Schematron files may be specified on the command line.

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS. DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING YET.

Sample invocation:
$ calabash.sh xproc/test.xpl epubdir=../tmp
Relative filenames are relative to the xproc subdir.
